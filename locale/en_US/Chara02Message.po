you can press and hold the button with the \"?\" mark 
to display help, so try that if you get stuck."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next up is <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Chain Notes\"</> 
It looks similar to Touch Notes."
msgstr ""
msgid "Even if they keep falling one after another, 
you just have to <span color=\"#E5006D\">hold down</s> the button beforehand and you'll be fine."
msgstr ""
msgid "Are you no good...?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Yes, that's it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It may look difficult at first glance, but I think it's much easier than it looks. Give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "By the way, notes only appear in this <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Guidelines\"</>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You don't have to look at the screen all the way through. 
How's that? You can do that, right?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Next is <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Hold Notes\"</> 
When you get to a long note, press and hold it <span color=\"#E5006D\">until the end</>. 
It's okay if you don't release your hand at the end of the note."
msgstr ""
msgid "Hah, what a waste of time."
msgstr ""
msgid "You have to be careful not to move your hands out of position because you might bend or turn like this."
msgstr ""
msgid "Yeah, I think that's fine."
msgstr ""
msgid "Then it's your turn next."
msgstr ""
msgid "
That's right, during the actual game there is something called a <span color=\"#E5006D\">norma gauge</> 

It's a gauge that fills up depending on how you play."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well, even if you can't clear it,
it's not game over.
So feel free to play any song you like."
msgstr ""
msgid "If you finish playing the song and it is above the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norm line</>, you've cleared it."
msgstr ""
msgid "How's that? Did you get it? I'm looking forward to seeing what you do."
msgstr ""
msgid "So let's actually try it."
msgstr ""
msgid "There is also a pattern in the opposite direction. 
The operation method is the same. 
The colors change depending on the direction, so it might be easier to understand if you remember them by the colors."
msgstr ""
msgid "This is \"slide notes.\" 
Imagine sliding the WACCA console in the direction of the arrow."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next, I'll explain <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Slide Notes\"</> and 

<span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Snap Notes\"</> together because their operation methods are similar."
msgstr ""
msgid "You... you're really making fun of me, aren't you...?"
msgstr ""
msgid "That's pretty good..."
msgstr ""
msgid "So let's practice together."
msgstr ""
msgid "This is \"Snap Notes.\" 
The strategy is the same as for Slide Notes."
msgstr ""
msgid "When this note comes, 
slide the WACCA console <span color=\"#E5006D\">forward</>. 
In this case, do the opposite. 
Slide it <span color=\"#E5006D\">towards the screen</>."
msgstr ""
msgid "What you're operating right now is the <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"WACCA Console\"</> 
That's the glowing device in front of you. 
We'll be using this <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"WACCA Console\"</> to play."
msgstr ""
msgid "First, the basic operation \"Touch Notes\" 
When the note overlaps the <span color=\"#E5006D\">judgment line</span>, 
\"Touch\" the WACCA console!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The notes come in various sizes, but as long as you're within the area, it's OK to touch anywhere."
msgstr ""
msgid "I'm teaching you, are you messing around?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Yes, that's about it."
msgstr ""
msgid "Okay, then you try it."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well then, I'll show you how to use WACCA. 
Okay? I'm only going to explain it once, so are you listening carefully?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Let me explain about VIP membership. 
You can become a VIP member for 30 days for 300 yen.

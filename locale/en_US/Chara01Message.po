msgid "Are you playing with your smartphone too?"
msgstr ""
msgid "That's right! That's it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "You might be surprised at the number of steps, but don't worry, it's much easier than it looks. Okay, now it's your turn."

msgid "By the way, notes only appear in these <span color=\"#E5006D\">guidelines</s>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You don't have to look at the whole screen. \nEasier than you think, right?"
msgstr ""
msgid "When you get to a long note, <span color=\"#E5006D\">hold note</s> \nAlign it with the area and press and hold <span color=\"#E5006D\">until the end of the note</s>. \nYou don't have to release your hand at the end."

msgid "Then you give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "That's right, during the actual game there's something called a <span color=\"#E5006D\">norma gauge</> \nand the gauge fills up depending on how you play."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well, even if you can't clear it, it won't be game over, so just give it a try!"

msgid "If you're above the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norma line</> when you finish playing the song, you've cleared it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Well then, good luck with the performance! I'm looking forward to seeing you."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well, it's probably quicker to just try it."
msgstr ""
msgid "There is also a pattern in the opposite direction. The operation is the same. \nThe color changes depending on the direction, so it might be a good idea to memorize it by the color."
msgstr ""
msgid "These are the <span color=\"#E5006D\">slide notes</s> \n<span color=\"#E5006D\">slide</s> the WACCA console in the <span color=\"#E5006D\">direction</s> of the arrow."
msgstr ""
msgid "The rest are <span color=\"#E5006D\">slide notes</> and \n<span color=\"#E5006D\">snap notes</>. \nI'll explain them all together!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Are you doing it on purpose so that I'll get mad at you?"
msgstr ""
msgid "OK! Looks like there's no problem!"
msgstr ""
msgid "So let's practice together."
msgstr ""
msgid "These are <span color=\"#E5006D\">snap notes</s> \nThe operation is the same as slide notes."
msgstr ""
msgid "When this note comes, slide the WACCA console \n<span color=\"#E5006D\">forward</>. \nThe red one is the other way around. Slide it <span color=\"#E5006D\">towards the screen</>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You have a ring-like device in front of you, right? \nWe call it the <span color=\"#E5006D\">WACCA Console</>. \nWe'll be using this <span color=\"#E5006D\">WACCA Console</> to play."
msgstr ""
msgid "First, the basic operation: <span color=\"#E5006D\">Touch Notes</s> \nWhen the note overlaps the <span color=\"#E5006D\">judgment line</s>, \ntouch the WACCA console!"
msgstr ""
msgid "The notes come in various sizes, but as long as you're within the area, <span color=\"#E5006D\">it's OK to touch anywhere</span>!"
msgstr ""
msgid "None of them have been successful though... \nAre you motivated?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Great job! Was it too easy?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Okay, then you try it."

Stage Up is a place to test your skills. 
You play a set number of songs in succession."

msgid "WACCA!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Let's announce the results this time."
msgstr ""
msgid "While playing, you can press and hold the button with the \"?\" mark 

to display help, so try that if you get stuck."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next I'll explain about <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Chain Notes\"</span>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You don't have to touch these notes. 
Just press and hold them down in advance and they will respond."
msgstr ""
msgid "Ah ha ha!...that's a funny joke."
msgstr ""
msgid "Yep. That's it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It might be a bit surprising when they come down one after the other, but I don't think it's as hard as you think. Give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "By the way, notes only come in this <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Guidelines\"</>"
msgstr ""
msgid "Just focus on the \"Guidelines\".

What do you think?

Doesn't that seem easier than you thought?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Next up are <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"hold notes</>. 
You press and hold these notes. 
You don't have to release your hand at the end of the note."
msgstr ""
msgid "Don't you think there's no point in wasting your time?"
msgstr ""
msgid "The notes may bend and turn, so make sure your hands stay on the notes."
msgstr ""
msgid "Yes! That's impressive."
msgstr ""
msgid "Go ahead, give it a try!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Finally, let me briefly explain the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norma gauge</span>. 
This gauge fills up if you play well."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well, even if you can't clear it,
it won't be game over, so feel free to give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "If you finish playing the song and it is above the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norm line</s>, you've cleared it."
msgstr ""
msgid "That's all for my explanation. 
Now, it's finally here. 
I can't wait to see what you do!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Shall we get started?"
msgstr ""
msgid "There is also a pattern in the opposite direction. 
Just slide your hand along the arrow. 
The left and right sides are different colors."
msgstr ""
msgid "These are <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"slide notes.\"</> 
There are <span color=\"#E5006D\">arrows</s>, 
so slide your hands in that direction."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next, I'll explain <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"slide notes\"</> and 
<span color=\"#E5006D\">\"snap notes\"</> together."
msgstr ""
msgid "Are you really unable to do it, or are you just making fun of me?"
msgstr ""
msgid "I knew it. You're talented!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Okay, so let's practice together."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next time, let's learn them in the same way as \"snap notes\" and \"slide notes.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "When you get this note, 
slide the Wakka Console <span color=\"#E5006D\">forward</>. 
This one's the opposite. Slide it <span color=\"#E5006D\">towards the screen</>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You have a shiny device in front of you right now, right? 
That's called the <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"WACCA Console.\" 
We'll use this to play WACCA."
msgstr ""
msgid "Let's start with the basic operation, <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Touch Notes</s>. 
When the note overlaps the <span color=\"#E5006D\">judgment line</s>, 
\"touch\"</s> the Wakka console."
msgstr ""
msgid "There's no set size for the notes, 
but no matter what size they are, 
you just need to <span color=\"#E5006D\">touch one spot</span>."
msgstr ""
msgid "What's wrong? 
Are you kidding me?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Yeah, amazing!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It's your turn next."

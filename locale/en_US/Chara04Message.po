msgstr ""
msgid "You don't have to touch these notes. \nJust press and hold them down in advance and they will respond."
msgstr ""
msgid "Ah ha ha!...that's a funny joke."
msgstr ""
msgid "Yep. That's it!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It might be a bit surprising when they come down one after the other, but I don't think it's as hard as you think. Give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "By the way, notes only come in this <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Guidelines\"</>"
msgstr ""
msgid "Just focus on the \"Guidelines\".\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDoesn't that seem easier than you thought?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Next up are <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"hold notes</>. \nYou press and hold these notes. \nYou don't have to release your hand at the end of the note."
msgstr ""
msgid "Don't you think there's no point in wasting your time?"
msgstr ""
msgid "The notes may bend and turn, so make sure your hands stay on the notes."
msgstr ""
msgid "Yes! That's impressive."
msgstr ""
msgid "Go ahead, give it a try!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Finally, let me briefly explain the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norma gauge</span>. \nThis gauge fills up if you play well."
msgstr ""
msgid "Well, even if you can't clear it,\nit won't be game over, so feel free to give it a try."
msgstr ""
msgid "If you finish playing the song and it is above the <span color=\"#E5006D\">norm line</s>, you've cleared it."
msgstr ""
msgid "That's all for my explanation. \nNow, it's finally here. \nI can't wait to see what you do!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Shall we get started?"
msgstr ""
msgid "There is also a pattern in the opposite direction. \nJust slide your hand along the arrow. \nThe left and right sides are different colors."
msgstr ""
msgid "These are <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"slide notes.\"</> \nThere are <span color=\"#E5006D\">arrows</s>, \nso slide your hands in that direction."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next, I'll explain <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"slide notes\"</> and \n<span color=\"#E5006D\">\"snap notes\"</> together."
msgstr ""
msgid "Are you really unable to do it, or are you just making fun of me?"
msgstr ""
msgid "I knew it. You're talented!"
msgstr ""
msgid "Okay, so let's practice together."
msgstr ""
msgid "Next time, let's learn them in the same way as \"snap notes\" and \"slide notes.\""
msgstr ""
msgid "When you get this note, \nslide the Wakka Console <span color=\"#E5006D\">forward</>. \nThis one's the opposite. Slide it <span color=\"#E5006D\">towards the screen</>."
msgstr ""
msgid "You have a shiny device in front of you right now, right? \nThat's called the <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"WACCA Console.\" \nWe'll use this to play WACCA."
msgstr ""
msgid "Let's start with the basic operation, <span color=\"#E5006D\">\"Touch Notes</s>. \nWhen the note overlaps the <span color=\"#E5006D\">judgment line</s>, \n\"touch\"</s> the Wakka console."
msgstr ""
msgid "There's no set size for the notes, \nbut no matter what size they are, \nyou just need to <span color=\"#E5006D\">touch one spot</span>."
msgstr ""
msgid "What's wrong? \nAre you kidding me?"
msgstr ""
msgid "Yeah, amazing!"
msgstr ""
msgid "It's your turn next."
